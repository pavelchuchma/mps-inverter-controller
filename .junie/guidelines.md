# Junie Workspace Guidelines

This repository uses Junie. Please apply the following rules at the start of every new conversation/session:

1. Load AGENTS.md as authoritative project context before any analysis or code generation. Treat it as binding unless the user explicitly overrides it for the current session.
2. If AGENTS.md is missing or unreadable, inform the user and proceed with sensible defaults.
3. Keep these guidelines active for the duration of the session.

Notes:
- Do not modify repository files unless the current Effective Issue requests changes.
- Prefer minimal, targeted edits and preserve existing code style.
